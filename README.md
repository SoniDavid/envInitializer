# envInitializer
Environment initializer for common softwares/tools that I tend to use

## Why?
<p align="left"> I've seen that I tend to brake things up pretty easily... So I decided to auto install most of the things I use with a easy to download bash command </p>

## What it does
As the name of the repo states, it install packages commonly used by me. I've done it for MacOS (because I needed a reason to use my mac other than for the battery life) with the brew package manager, but I prefer other packet managers in linux, so I did with apt package manager for ubuntu 22.04. Feel free to use it yourself

## Note
I won't install ROS2 like this, instead just follow the documentation lol
